# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

 - I want to make a scene game about slice of life
 - I will be using Renpy and pygame engine for this project
 - another idea, is I'm going to make a spaceship battle with random enemies coming, just in case I'm short of time. the challege become harder as it receives specific score. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

 - I plan to collaborate with anyone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

 - I would start with Renpy then swich the engine to pygame and back to Renpy. It's as looks a loop but straightforward
 - how do I get the background image for renpy?
 - can I create video animation in a website that is actually free?
 - having a music track that is perfect for the script is a good idea, but how do I download it?
 - have making the dialouge in renpy, I know it would be multiple pack of them. how much time do I have to submit the project?
